<p>Cultural exchange is one of the primary goals of the U.S. Department of State supported Exchange Vistor Program. Each month CIEE will send Culture Guide USA via email with ideas and inspiration to really get to know the U.S. and its cultural varity.</p>

<p>You will be meeting many new people and experiencing new things. With this can come great joys as well as challenges. Tring to develope relationships in your host community helps with the process of getting used to a new culture. In addition to the internet and local newspaper, your supervisor and colleagues can serve as great resources for finding activities that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>In the workspace, U.S. business is <em>results-oriented</em> and formalities. Many companines try to limit corporate hierarchy and you may often find yourself in direct contact with senior managers in your organization. Also, calling a boss by a first name is common in the U.S. and is generally not a sign of disrespect. <em>Compliments</em> are exchanged frequently among colleagues and acquaintances. But, not asking colleagues about their personal relationships.</p>
