## Abstract

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme, unassuming and minimalist theme. I recommend to adopt this theme since it focuses more on content with complete software architecture. 

The most fantastic part is that it's free and you can fork [Lanyon repo](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), get it running in no time, and make the changes to include your details.

Here's a short tutorial on how I made this blog. Read to start? Let't go!

#### **NOTE: If you want to save time or are not interested to set up by yourself, simply fork [my repo](https://github.com/s311354/Louis.github.io), adjust the style and make changes to fit your requirements.**

## Instructions

### 1. Installing Rudy and Jekyll

Go ahead and type below command line in your termainal to install rudy: 

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="nb">$ brew install ruby
</span></code></pre></div>

Here, we type this on the MAC OS X and will use ruby v2.5.1p57 version.

Then, you'll also need Rudygems which is a package management framework for Rudy. Refer to [RubyGems instructions](https://rubygems.org/pages/download/). 

Finally, we can install jekyll!!

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="nb">$ gem install jekyll
</span></code></pre></div>

#### **REMARK: If you use ubuntu or linux operating systems, you should type apt-get instead of brew when you install rudy.**

### 2. Clone Lanyon 

First of all, we will need to create an account of Github and a repository having the name **username.github.io**. For instance, my repo name is *Louis.github.io*. After you do this, clone this repository onto your local computer. 

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="nb">$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
</span></code></pre></div>

Next, download the Lanyon zip folder from [here](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/archive/master.zip) and extract those into your *username.github.io* directory. Now, you already prepare a prerequisite for build your local environment.

Let's move into *username.github.io* directory and run the default page on local server. 

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="nb">$ cd username.github.io
$ jekyll build
$ jekyll serve
</span></code></pre></div>

Unfortunately, since Lanyon is built on Poole and Poole does not support Jekyll 3 yet, you would get error message, [permalink issue](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/issues/124). For fixing this issue, you'll need to comment out *relative permalinks: true* and add *jekyll-paginate setting*, as shown below

<figure>
<a><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/picture/permalinks_issue.png" width="120%"></a>
</figure>

<figure>
<a><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/picture/paginate.png" width="40%"></a>
</figure>

#### **REMARK: Replace username with your *specific username*.** 

### 3. Configuring baseurl

In order to match the production URL without the host, you'll need to set *baseurl* in your *_config.yml*. From [Parker's blog](https://byparker.com/blog/2014/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/#fn:1),

  >The *baseurl* was originally added back in 2010 to allow "the user to test websit with the internal webserver under the same base url it will be deployed to on a production server".

So, let's configure the subpath of your site based on your repository username. 

<figure>
<a><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/picture/baseurl_setting.png" width="150%"></a>
</figure>

After that, you should execute *jekyll serve -w*, and must make sure everything works on local. Feeling free to prepend your urls with *site.baseurl* to indicate specific URL. Then, pushing to your host and also checking that everything works, too! 

### 4. Exploring the directory structure

Before we go ahead and make customization, let's take a look at the overview of architecture in your directory. Once understanding the structure, we can confidently adjust the format and add several customized designs. 

<figure>
<a><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/picture/structure.png"></a>
</figure>

The overview of structure:

 -  _config.yml:

    The configuration file, which placed in your site's root directory, gives you a lot of flexibility to customize how it builds your site. [options](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/)
 - index.html:
    
    This configures your front page. 
 - about.md and archive.md:
    
    This is the Makedown files and will be transformed by Jekyll to a static page. You can add other static page by creating Makedown files with a [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) section.
 - _includes and _layouts:
    
    These directories contain the HTML boilerplate required to build your site.
 - _posts:
    
    This directory includes the posts that you will be posting. They are Markdown files.
