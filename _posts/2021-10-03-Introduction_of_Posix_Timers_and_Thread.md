## Abstract ##
POSIX time is a system for describing a point in time, also known as Unit time. It is widely used in operation systems and file formats. The C POSIX library is a specification of a C standard library for POSIX systems, which includes the time types and functions definied in <time.h> header file. Recently, one of my friends shared the conception of POSIX timer with me. But, I seldom used and was not focus on the POSIX-TIMERS API before. So that I roughly survey this topic and try to sort the relative information out in this post. Here we go.

## POSIX Timers C API ##
Summary of C standard library for POSIX systems:
<table>
 <tr>
  <th>Function</th>
  <th>Description</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>clock_settime()</td>
  <td>Set Clock to a specified value</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>clock_gettime()</td>
  <td>Get value of clock</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>timer_settime()</td>
  <td>Set and arm or disarm a timer</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>timer_gettime()</td>
  <td>Get remaining interval for an active timer</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>timer_create()</td>
  <td>Create a timer</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>timer_delete()</td>
  <td>Delete a timer</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>clock_getres()</td>
  <td>Get resolution of clock</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>timer_getoverrun()</td>
  <td>Get current overrun count for a timer</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>nanosleep()</td>
  <td>Delay the current thread with high resolution</td>
 </tr>
</table>

Even if these functions seem not be implemented in Mac OS X, we can still take a look at the simple example of timer posted in [stackover flow][stackoverflow] and further compile it and understand how the timer works. The porpose of this program is to count down 10 seconds , and hopefully only print the "Hello, World!" with the new thread to console.

**Note**: 
- pthread_create function starts a new thread in the calling process. The new thread starts execution by invoking start_routine(). arg is passed as the sole argument of start_routine().

      int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);

- pthread_t type is definied as described in <sys/types.h> 
- A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the process code, including parts currently being executing by another thread.
