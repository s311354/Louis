## Who am I ##

My name is Shi-Rong Liu, and I am a Senior Engineer. My research and engineering interests are mainly in the area of open-source, general computer science, and user-friendly software engineering.

## About This Site ##

This website was formally built in the Autumn of 2022, but migrating from [Jekyll][jekyll] to Hexo and changing to this style.

The main purposes of this website are list here:

+ Discuss the technical details of user-friendly software engineering/tool, and computer sciences
+ Document the implementation of algorithms for solving real problems
+ Present my independent side projects
+ Record my personal achievements, and experiences

It should be noted that all the contents of this website are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.
